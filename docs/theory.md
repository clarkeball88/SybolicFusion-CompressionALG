# Core Theories

## Symbolic Recursive Accuracy Hypothesis
A new theory asserting that symbolic recursion naturally reduces error by reinforcing patterns and symbolic ratios.

## Fusion Through Code
Postulates that perfect symbolic compression (100%) could create self-sustaining software systems — effectively the digital equivalent of fusion.

## Decimal Rejection
The system rejects irrational and decimal approximations in favor of pure symbolic ratios, redefining constants like π, √2, and φ.

## Symbolic Evolution
The algorithm evolves with each use, compressing better, learning more, and generating higher accuracy over time.
