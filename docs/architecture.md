# Architecture Overview

## Mirrored Symbolic Digits
- Each symbolic number has a mirrored pair: e.g., 1 ↔ 11, 2 ↔ 12, etc.
- This creates a clock-like dual encoding, enabling binary-like structure without zero.

## Symbolic ALU
- Supports symbolic ADD, SUB, NOT, AND, OR, XOR.
- All operations are mirrored and verified by symbolic test cases.

## Macro Folding
- Frequently used symbolic patterns are compressed into reusable macros.
- Allows high-density code with minimal symbolic footprint.

## Symbolic Constants
- π = ⟦2,2⟧ ÷ ⟦7⟧
- √2 = ⟦9,9⟧ ÷ ⟦7,0⟧
- φ = ⟦8,9⟧ ÷ ⟦5,5⟧
