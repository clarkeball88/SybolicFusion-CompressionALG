# Introduction

This symbolic programming system introduces a fundamentally new architecture for computation by eliminating the concept of zero and decimals. Instead, it uses mirrored digit pairs, symbolic recursion, and macro-folded logic to compress computation into a minimal form.

The system is designed to evolve over time, reducing errors and increasing efficiency with use. This approach promises to revolutionize everything from compression to artificial intelligence, VR, and even medical technologies.
