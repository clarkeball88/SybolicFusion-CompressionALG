# Symbolic Compression System

**Inventor**: Clarke Ball  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**License**: MIT

## 🔷 Overview

The Symbolic Compression System introduces a new era in computational mathematics by replacing decimals, negatives, and zero with a mirrored, recursive symbolic number system. This system powers an ultra-efficient symbolic programming language capable of self-recursive macro compression, symbolic logic operations, and lossless encoding. This technology has implications across AI, compression, VR, encryption, and theoretical energy models — including the idea of *fusion through code*.

## 🧠 Key Features

- ✅ Zero-Free Symbolic Math – Zero is replaced with mirrored symbolic digits (1–6 ↔ 11–16, etc.)  
- ✅ Macro Folding – Recursive self-compression using symbolic macro libraries  
- ✅ Tiered Compression System – Supports multi-stage symbolic program compression  
- ✅ Symbolic Constants – Expresses π, √2, φ with finite mirrored symbolic representations  
- ✅ Mirrored ALU Operations – ADD, SUB, NOT, AND, OR, XOR defined for symbolic digits  
- ✅ Recursive Accuracy – Accuracy increases with program recursion and symbolic depth  
- ✅ Fusion Logic – Proposes that full symbolic recursion could eliminate power dependency

## 📜 Core Theories

“Fusion doesn’t come from the earth — it lies in code.” — Clarke Ball

The symbolic system is rooted in the following hypotheses:

- **Symbolic Recursive Accuracy Hypothesis**  
A zero-less mirrored symbolic system with macro-folded compression converges toward perfect symbolic accuracy and error reduction.

- **Fusion Through Code Theory**  
At 100% recursive compression, software may become self-sustaining — a symbolic equivalent of fusion, requiring no external input once initialized.

## 💡 Symbolic Logic System

The symbolic digit sets form a new number line using pairs such as:

- (1,2,3,4,5,6) mirrored by (11,12,13,14,15,16)  
- Extended into sets like (21–26) ↔ (31–36), etc.

Operations are tested and validated through mirrored symbolic logic:

Examples:  
⟦2,2⟧ + ⟦3,3⟧ => ⟦5,5⟧  
⟦9,9⟧ ÷ ⟦7,0⟧ => MACRO_SQRT2

## 🧪 Running the Tests

To verify compression and logic consistency:

```bash
cd symbolic-compression-system
python -m unittest discover tests
```

All major symbolic functions are tested:

- Symbolic ADD/SUB  
- Macro folding  
- Constants (π, √2, φ)  
- Recursive programs  

---

## 📊 Compression Benchmarks

Inside `/benchmark/`, you’ll find:

- Fibonacci Program: ~92.3% compression  
- Symbolic macro folding tested at multiple recursion levels  
- All examples stored as lossless symbolic sequences  

This system rivals and may surpass existing algorithmic compression in targeted domains (e.g. symbolic logic, theoretical math programs, recursive computing environments).

---

## 🧪 Example Programs

Located in `/examples/`, these demonstrate:

- Fibonacci sequence in mirrored symbolic form  
- Prime number generator using symbolic recursion  
- Conditional folding with symbolic macros  
- Symbolic definitions for π, √2, φ  

Each is compressed, tested, and validates the full symbolic ALU structure.
